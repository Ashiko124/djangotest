I think my problems started with instructions in the beggining. From the start i didn't know if i was setting up heroku with the sprint repo or my djorg repo. I finished all the steps and deployed the sprint repo but it had errors and I couldn't figure out what it wanted.

Thinking i did it wrong i went through and re-did all the steps for my djorg repo but again when i go to deploy i get a mess of errors. 

I have had problems with Django from the start not installing dependicies correctly so I am guessing this is the reason for all my errors. I am going through and slowly removing and making sure everything i need is there but its obvious that in the time given I won't be able to get it deployed. I am not even sure which repo to submit for the PR so im submitting both
